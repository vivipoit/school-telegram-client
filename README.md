# telegram-client

This is a Python script that uses [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) to create a Telegram group and return an invite link.

## Run locally

Follow the steps below to run the `create_group.py` script with its static string values.

1. run `git clone git@github.com:vivipoit/telegram-client.git`
2. navigate into directory
3. run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install packages
4. run `source env/bin/activate` to activate Python environment
5. update the `.setEnvironmentVariables.sh.example` file with your values and remove `.example` from the filename
    - `SESSION_STRING` is generated by following Telethon's String Sessions instructions [here](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/concepts/sessions.html#string-sessions)
    - `API_ID` and `API_HASH` are generated by following Telegram's API instructions [here](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)
6. run `chmod +x .setEnvironmentVariables.sh` to make sure the script can run
7. run `source .setEnvironmentVariables.sh` to export the variables
8. run `python create_group.py` to see code run and display the invite link for the newly created group

## Run on AWS Lambda

The code in `aws/lambda_function.py` is a bit more sophisticated, because instead of static string values, it expects the AWS Lambda event to have a body similar to this:

```json
{
  "course": {
    "id": 9,
    "subject": "math",
    "teacher_email_address": "this@teacher.com"
  }
}
```

The function uses the information in the body to build the group's and the link's titles.

### Example:

#### Request:

`curl -v -d '{"course":{"id": 9,"subject":"math","teacher_email_address":"this@teacher.com"}}' $LAMBDA_URL -H "Content-Type: application/json"`

#### Title for group to be created:

`"math with this@teacher.com (#9)"`

### AWS Lambda layer for loading Telethon

`aws/telethon_layer.zip` is a file that can be uploaded as the layer for the function to use.
